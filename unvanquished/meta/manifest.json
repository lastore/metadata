Players can choose from either team, providing for an entirely different experience on both sides, as humans focus on long-range firepower while aliens rely instead on quick movement and stealth. The goal of each match is to destroy the enemy base. Upgrades for both teams are earned by a combination of individual performance and team map control, unlocking access to more powerful weapons and equipment for the humans, and larger, more ferocious forms for the aliens.","locales":{"zh_CN":{"description":"Unvanquished是一款实时策略元素的射击游戏，玩家可以选择团队，提供双方的一个完全不同的体验，作为人类专注于远程火力而外星人依靠快速运动和隐身。每场比赛的目标是摧毁敌人的基地，通过结合个体绩效和团队地图控制获得升级，解锁更强大的武器和装备来加入战斗。","name":"Unvanquished","screenshots":[{"size":"347x260","src":"screenshots/zh_CN/phpy0FiRZ.png"},{"size":"347x260","src":"screenshots/zh_CN/php9CaI6m.png"},{"size":"347x260","src":"screenshots/zh_CN/php4dCqjG.png"},{"size":"347x260","src":"screenshots/zh_CN/phpfydLgE.png"},{"size":"347x260","src":"screenshots/zh_CN/php8yU6tw.png"}]}}}
