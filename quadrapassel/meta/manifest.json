The goal of the game is to create complete horizontal lines of blocks, which will disappear. The blocks come in seven different shapes made from four blocks each: one straight, two L-shaped, one square, and two S-shaped. The blocks fall from the top center of the screen in a random order. You rotate the blocks and move them across the screen to drop them in complete lines. You score by dropping blocks fast and completing lines. As your score gets higher, you level up and the blocks fall faster.","locales":{"zh_CN":{"description":"Quadrapassel是一款俄罗斯方块游戏，由四块方块组成不同的形状（长条形/L形/正方形/S形），方块从一个随机顺序的屏幕顶部下降，玩家对方块进行旋转和移动，在屏幕上做出完整的线来得分，通过提高技能来加快方块的下降速度获取更多的分数。","name":"Quadrapassel","screenshots":[{"size":"276x260","src":"screenshots/zh_CN/phpapjdyg.png"},{"size":"276x260","src":"screenshots/zh_CN/phpLdP5Fl.png"},{"size":"276x260","src":"screenshots/zh_CN/php2jBsps.png"},{"size":"276x260","src":"screenshots/zh_CN/phpMeMAsf.png"}]}}}
